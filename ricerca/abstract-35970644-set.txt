Post-SSRI sexual dysfunction (PSSD) is a set of heterogeneous sexual problems, 
which may arise during the administration of selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors (SSRIs) and persist after their discontinuation. PSSD is a rare 
clinical entity, and it is commonly associated with non-sexual concerns, 
including emotional and cognitive problems and poor quality of life. To date, 
however, no effective treatment is available. The aim of this study was to 
retrospectively evaluate the potential efficacy of the different treatments used 
in clinical practice in improving male PSSD. Of the 30 patients referred to our 
neurobehavioral outpatient clinic from January 2020 to December 2021, 13 
Caucasian male patients (mean age 29.53 ± 4.57 years), previously treated with 
SSRIs, were included in the study. Patients with major depressive disorder 
and/or psychotic symptoms were excluded a priori to avoid overlapping 
symptomatology, and potentially reduce the misdiagnosis rate. To treat PSSD, we 
decided to use drugs positively affecting the brain dopamine/serotonin ratio, 
such as bupropion and vortioxetine, as well as other compounds. This latter drug 
is known not to cause or reverse iatrogenic SD. Most patients, after treatment 
with vortioxetine and/or nutraceuticals, reported a significant improvement in 
all International Index of Erectile Function-(IIEF-5) domains (p &lt; 0.05) from 
baseline (T0) to 12-month follow-up (T1). Moreover, the only patient treated 
with pelvic muscle vibration reached very positive results. Although our data 
come from a retrospective open-label study with a small sample size, drugs 
positively modulating the central nervous system serotonin/dopamine ratio, such 
as vortioxetine, could be used to potentially improve PSSD. Large-sample 
prospective cohort studies and randomized clinical trials are needed to 
investigate the real prevalence of this clinical entity and confirm such a 
promising approach to a potentially debilitating illness.

BACKGROUND: Sexual dysfunction is highly prevalent worldwide. A specific form is 
persistent sexual dysfunction after SSRI withdrawal. We conducted a systematic 
literature review in order to characterize factors related to post SSRI sexual 
dysfunction (PSSD) and analyzed spontaneous reports of persistent sexual 
dysfunction reported to the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Center Lareb.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted 
following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. In addition, reports of PSSD submitted to 
the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Center Lareb between 1992 and 2021 were 
analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 237 articles were retrieved through the search and 33 
articles were selected for inclusion in this review, in accordance with the 
inclusion criteria. Information regarding the characteristics of the condition, 
its clinical management, patient characteristics, and impact of PSSD is 
presented. A total of 86 reports of persistent sexual dysfunction were analyzed. 
The longest case being a patient with PSSD for 23 years. The main symptoms were: 
loss or decreased libido (n = 53), erectile dysfunction (n = 23) and anorgasmia 
(n = 5).
CONCLUSIONS: PSSD impact includes sexual, psychological, and social 
consequences. Little is known about the mechanisms underlying PSSD and no 
effective treatment exists. It is necessary to increase recognition of PSSD 
among prescribers and improve its management at the clinical level.

BACKGROUND: A set of enduring conditions have been reported in the literature 
involving persistent sexual dysfunction after discontinuation of serotonin 
reuptake inhibiting antidepressants, 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors and 
isotretinoin.
OBJECTIVE: To develop diagnostic criteria for post-SSRI sexual dysfunction 
(PSSD), persistent genital arousal disorder (PGAD) following serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors, post-finasteride syndrome (PFS) and post-retinoid sexual dysfunction 
(PRSD).
METHODS: The original draft was designed using data from two published case 
series (Hogan et al., 2014 and Healy et al., 2018), which represent the largest 
public collections of data on these enduring conditions. It was further 
developed with the involvement of a multidisciplinary panel of experts.
RESULTS: A set of criteria were agreed upon for each of the above conditions. 
Features of PSSD, PFS and PRSD commonly include decreased genital and orgasmic 
sensation, decreased sexual desire and erectile dysfunction. Ancillary 
non-sexual symptoms vary depending on the specific condition but can include 
emotional blunting and cognitive impairment. PGAD presents with an almost mirror 
image of unwanted sensations of genital arousal or irritability in the absence 
of sexual desire. A new term, post-SSRI asexuality, is introduced to describe a 
dampening of sexual interest and pleasure resulting from a pre-natal or pre-teen 
exposure to a serotonin reuptake inhibitor.
CONCLUSIONS: These criteria will help in both clinical and research settings. As 
with all criteria, they will likely need modification in the light of 
developments.

INTRODUCTION: Post-SSRI sexual-dysfunction (PSSD) is an iatrogenic syndrome, the 
underlying neurobiological mechanisms of which are unclear. Symptom onset 
follows cessation of serotonergic antidepressants i.e. Selective Serotonin and 
Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI's, SNRI's), and Tricyclic 
antidepressants (TCA's). PSSD symptoms include genital anesthesia, erectile 
dysfunction and orgasmic/ejaculatory anhedonia, and should be differentiated 
from depression-related sexual-dysfunction. Recently, accumulated data of 
numerous case-reports suggest additional non-sexual symptoms including, 
anhedonia, apathy, and blunted affect. PSSD gained official recognition after 
the European medical agency concluded that PSSD is a medical condition that 
persists after discontinuation of SSRI's and SNRI's.
OBJECTIVE: To review possible underlying neurobiological mechanisms of this 
syndrome, update information on the pathophysiology, present a list of potential 
risk-factors and discuss potential management options for PSSD.
METHODS: Extensive literature review on the main symptom-patterns of this 
disorder was undertaken using PubMed. It includes introductory explications of 
relevant neurobiology with the objective of generating hypothesis.
RESULTS: Precipitating factors for PSSD include previous exposure to certain 
drugs, genetic predisposition, psychological stress or chemical stressful 
reaction to antidepressants along pre-existing medical conditions affecting 
neuroplasticity. Different theories have been proposed to explain the 
pathophysiology of PSSD: epigenetic gene expression, dopamine-serotonin 
interactions, serotonin neurotoxicity and hormonal changes. The diagnosis of 
PSSD is achieved by excluding all other etiologies of sexual-dysfunction. 
Treatment is challenging, and many strategies have been suggested without 
definitive outcomes. We offer the contours of a future neurobiological research 
agenda, and propose several underlying mechanisms for the various symptoms of 
PSSD which could be the foundation for a future treatment algorithm.
CONCLUSION: There is a need for well-designed neurobiological research in this 
domain, as well as in the prevalence, pathophysiology, and treatment of PSSD. 
Practitioners should be alert to the distinctive features of PSSD. Misdiagnosing 
this syndrome might lead to harmful treatments including reinstatement of 
medications which generated PSSD. Sexual Medicine Reviews. Peleg LC, Rabinovitch

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) show high efficacy in treating 
depression, however during treatment side effects, like for instance sexual 
dysfunction, may appear, decreasing compliance. In some cases, this condition 
will last after drug discontinuation, leading to the so-called post-SSRI sexual 
dysfunction (PSSD). The etiology of PSSD is still unknown, however a role for 
neuroactive steroids may be hypothesized. Indeed, these molecules are key 
physiological regulators of the nervous system, and their alteration has been 
associated with several neuropathological conditions, including depression. 
Additionally, neuroactive steroids are also involved in the control of sexual 
function. Interestingly, sexual dysfunction induced by SSRI treatment has been 
also observed in animal models. On this basis, we have here evaluated whether a 
subchronic treatment with paroxetine for two weeks and/or its withdrawal (i.e., 
a month) may affect the levels of neuroactive steroids in brain areas (i.e., 
hippocampus, hypothalamus, and cerebral cortex) and/or in plasma and 
cerebrospinal fluid of male rats. Data obtained indicate that the SSRI treatment 
alters neuroactive steroid levels and the expression of key enzymes of the 
steroidogenesis in a brain tissue- and time-dependent manner. Indeed, these 
observations with the finding that plasma levels of neuroactive steroids are not 
affected suggest that the effect of paroxetine treatment is directly on 
neurosteroidogenesis. In particular, a negative impact on the expression of 
steroidogenic enzymes was observed at the withdrawal. Therefore, it is possible 
to hypothesize that altered neurosteroidogenesis may also occur in PSSD and 
consequently it may represent a possible pharmacological target for this 
disorder.

BACKGROUND: Post-SSRI sexual dysfunction (PSSD) is an underrecognized and poorly 
understood medical condition characterized by sexual dysfunction that persists 
despite SSRI discontinuation.
OBJECTIVE: We conducted a survey of individuals with PSSD to better characterize 
this condition and its impact on various quality of life concerns.
METHODS: Surveys were distributed to an online support group for individuals 
with PSSD. Surveys assessed medications suspected of causing PSSD and symptoms 
experienced during and after treatment. Respondents reported the trajectory of 
their condition, the efficacy of different treatments, and the impact of PSSD on 
their quality of life.
RESULTS: 239 survey responses were included in this study. A majority of 
respondents had a history of SSRI use (92%) compared to only SNRI or atypical 
antidepressant use (8%). The overall severity of symptoms improved for 45% and 
worsened or remained the same for 37% of respondents after discontinuing 
treatment with serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Only 12% of respondents reported 
being counseled regarding potential sexual dysfunction while taking 
antidepressants. The majority rated the effect of PSSD on their quality of life 
as extremely negative (59%) or very negative (23%).
CONCLUSION: PSSD can have an overwhelmingly negative impact on quality of life. 
Currently, it is unclear why certain individuals develop PSSD and there are no 
definitive treatments for this condition. Further research of PSSD and greater 
awareness of this condition is needed among prescribers of serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors to improve patient care.

BACKGROUND: Post-SSRI Sexual Dysfunction (PSSD) is characterized by sexual and 
emotional symptoms associated to the exposure to Selective Serotonin Reuptake 
Inhibitors (SSRI) or Serotonin Noradrenaline Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRI).
OBJECTIVE: The present study provides a comprehensive picture on demographic and 
clinical characteristics associated to PSSD.
METHODS: An online survey was run on subjects self-declaring as affected by 
PSSD. The survey collected socio-demographic and clinical data via questions 
created ad hoc and three standardized scales (Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale, 
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, World Health Organization Wellbeing 
Index).
RESULTS: A total of 135 subjects (115 males; mean age 31.9 ± 8.9 years) was 
analysed. The syndrome was more represented among young, heterosexual males 
after the exposure to SSRI/SNRI at relatively high doses. The major findings 
involved the temporal sequence of symptoms: 118 subjects had symptoms both 
during and after SSRI/SNRI administration, and 17 only after, thus deposing for 
a iatrogenic action of SSRI/SNRI. Different variables, represented by both 
emotional and sexual symptoms, accounted for the variability of the severity of 
the sexual dysfunction as well as of wellbeing.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the present results, PSSD is a complex iatrogenic syndrome 
in need of being further studied and understood.

Antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction.

Network, Adelaide, SA.

Sexual dysfunction is a frequent, potentially distressing, adverse effect of 
antidepressants and a leading cause of medication non-adherence. Sexual function 
should be actively assessed at baseline, at regular intervals during treatment, 
and after treatment cessation. Trials comparing the risk of sexual dysfunction 
with individual antidepressants are inadequate, but it is reasonable to conclude 
that the risk is greatest with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) 
and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), less with tricyclic 
antidepressants (except clomipramine) and mirtazapine, and least with 
moclobemide, agomelatine, reboxetine and bupropion. Management of 
antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction requires an individualised approach 
(eg, considering other causes, dose reduction, addition of medication to treat 
the adverse effect, switching to a different antidepressant). Post-SSRI sexual 
dysfunction has been recently identified as a potential, although rare, adverse 
effect of SSRIs and SNRIs. Consider the possibility of post-SSRI sexual 
dysfunction in patients in whom sexual dysfunction was absent before starting 
antidepressants but develops during or soon after antidepressant treatment and 
still persists after remission from depression and discontinuation of the drug.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) drugs, targeting serotonin 
transport, are widely used. A puzzling and biomedically important phenomenon 
concerns the persistent sexual dysfunction following SSRI use seen in some 
patients. What could be the mechanism of a persistent physiological state 
brought on by a transient exposure to serotonin transport blockers? In this 
study, we briefly review the clinical facts concerning this side effect of 
serotonin reuptake inhibitors and suggest a possible mechanism. Bioelectric 
circuits (among neural or non-neural cells) could persistently maintain 
alterations of bioelectric cell properties (resting potential), resulting in 
long-term changes in electrophysiology and signaling. We present new data 
revealing this phenomenon in planarian flatworms, in which brief SSRI exposures 
induce long-lasting changes in resting potential profile. We also briefly review 
recent data linking neurotransmitter signaling to developmental bioelectrics. 
Further study of tissue bioelectric memory could enable the design of 
ionoceutical interventions to counteract side effects of SSRIs and similar 
drugs.

Enduring sexual difficulties following treatment with selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitor antidepressants have been reported to regulators since 1991, 
but it was only in 2006 that a formal post-SSRI sexual dysfunction syndrome was 
reported. The clinical, research and regulatory implications of this syndrome 
are considerable and researchers using epidemiological methods are well placed 
to map out the contours of the problem and perhaps pinpoint possible treatments.

OBJECTIVE: A petition to the European Medicines Agency provided an opportunity 
to collect reports of a specific adverse event from patients and healthcare 
professionals, along with details of clinicians' attitudes when asked to endorse 
patient reports.
METHODS: We approached a cohort of patients reporting post-SSRI sexual 
dysfunction (PSSD) to an adverse event reporting website, RxISK.org. The 
responses of patients on their interactions with healthcare professionals were 
subject to a qualitative analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 62 participants from 23 countries provided details of their 
experiences. While some had received support and validation of their condition, 
many described a number of difficulties including a lack of awareness or 
knowledge about PSSD, not being listened to, receiving unsympathetic or 
inappropriate responses, and a refusal to engage with the published medical 
literature.
CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare professionals are nervous about or reluctant to engage 
with novel problems on a treatment. This is not widely appreciated and the 
reasons for this concern are not understood.

Post-selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) sexual dysfunction (PSSD) 
is a new clinical entity occurring after the antidepressant intake, and it is 
characterized by the fact that patients continue to present sexual side effects 
after the discontinuation of the drugs. PSSD mainly consists of hypo-anesthesia 
of the genital area, loss of libido, and erectile dysfunction. Although 
different management options have been proposed, there is no consensus on the 
treatment for this syndrome. Herein we report on a young man affected by PSSD 
who regained sexual functioning after 3-month treatment with EDOVIS, a dietary 
supplement containing L-citrulline and other commonly used aphrodisiacs. 
Clinicians should be aware about the possibility of persistent sexual side 
effects induced by serotoninergic antidepressants and take into considerations 
the use of nutraceuticals to overcome PSSD.

Sexual dysfunction is a clinical condition due to different causes including the 
iatrogenic origin. For instance, it is well known that sexual dysfunction may 
occur in patients treated with antidepressants like selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors (SSRI). A similar side effect has been also reported during treatment 
with finasteride, an inhibitor of the enzyme 5alpha-reductase, for androgenetic 
alopecia. Interestingly, sexual dysfunction persists in both cases after drug 
discontinuation. These conditions have been named post-SSRI sexual dysfunction 
(PSSD) and post-finasteride syndrome (PFS). In particular, feeling of a lack of 
connection between the brain and penis, loss of libido and sex drive, difficulty 
in achieving an erection and genital paresthesia have been reported by patients 
of both conditions. It is interesting to note that the incidence of these 
diseases is probably so far underestimated and their etiopathogenesis is not 
sufficiently explored. To this aim, the present review will report the state of 
art of these two different pathologies and discuss, on the basis of the role 
exerted by three different neuromodulators such as dopamine, serotonin and 
neuroactive steroids, whether the persistent sexual dysfunction observed could 
be determined by common mechanisms.

Commonly used pharmaceutical drugs might alter the epigenetic state of cells, 
leading to varying degrees of long-term repercussions to human health. To test 
this hypothesis, we cultured HEK-293 cells in the presence of 50 μM citalopram, 
a common antidepressant, for 30 days and performed whole-genome DNA methylation 
analysis using the NimbleGen Human DNA Methylation 3x720K Promoter Plus CpG 
Island Array. A total of 626 gene promoters, out of a total of 25,437 queried 
genes on the array (2.46%), showed significant differential methylation (p < 
0.01); among these, 272 were hypomethylated and 354 were hypermethylated in 
treated versus control. Using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, we found that the 
chief gene networks and signaling pathways that are differentially regulated 
include those involved in nervous system development and function and cellular 
growth and proliferation. Genes implicated in depression, as well as genetic 
networks involving nucleic acid metabolism, small molecule biochemistry, and 
cell cycle regulation were significantly modified. Involvement of upstream 
regulators such as BDNF, FSH, and NFκB was predicted based on differential 
methylation of their downstream targets. The study validates our hypothesis that 
pharmaceutical drugs can have off-target epigenetic effects and reveals affected 
networks and pathways. We view this study as a first step towards understanding 
the long-term epigenetic consequences of prescription drugs on human health.

INTRODUCTION: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a widely used 
class of drug for various psychiatric disorders during the lifespan, including 
pregnancy, lactation, childhood, and adolescence. Deterioration in sexual 
functioning is a major and serious adverse effect of SSRIs. There is emerging 
evidence that SSRIs can have long-lasting effects on sexuality.
AIM: To summarize the long-lasting effects of SSRIs on sexuality, starting with 
animal models and continuing with the clinical experience of different 
investigators.
METHOD: A literature review of relevant publications in PubMed.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: To assess the long-lasting effects of SSRIs on sexuality.
RESULTS: Although the persistent effects of SSRIs on sexuality have been little 
studied in humans, animal studies suggest that SSRIs might cause permanent 
sexual dysfunction after ending SSRI exposure at a young age but not in 
adulthood in rats. There are no prospective randomized controlled trials in 
humans and the present evidence is derived from case reports, incidental 
research findings, and experiences of some internet communities.
CONCLUSION: There is some preclinical evidence from animal studies for enduring 
SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction, but the available clinical information could 
prevent a clear decision about the existence of post-SSRI sexual dysfunction, 
its pathophysiology, and its management. We need more research to fill in the 
gaps in our knowledge. Coskuner ER, Culha MG, Ozkan B, Kaleagasi EO. Post-SSRI

OBJECTIVE: To investigate clinical reports of post-SSRI sexual dysfunction 
(PSSD), post-finasteride syndrome (PFS) and enduring sexual dysfunction 
following isotretinoin.
METHODS: Data from RxISK.org, a global adverse event reporting website, have 
been used to establish the clinical features, demographic details and clinical 
trajectories of syndromes of persistent sexual difficulties following three 
superficially different treatment modalities.RESULTSWe report on 300 cases of 
enduring sexual dysfunction from 37 countries following 14 different drugs 
comprised of serotonin reuptake inhibiting antidepressants, 5α-reductase 
inhibitors and isotretinoin. While reports of certain issues were unique to the 
antidepressants, such as the onset of premature ejaculation and persistent 
genital arousal disorder (PGAD), there was also a significant overlap in symptom 
profile between the drug groups, with common features including genital 
anaesthesia, pleasureless or weak orgasm, loss of libido and impotence. 
Secondary consequences included relationship breakdown and impaired quality of 
life.CONCLUSIONSThese data point to a legacy syndrome or syndromes comprising a 
range of disturbances to sexual function. More detailed studies will require 
developments in coding systems that recognise the condition(s). Further 
exploration of these tardive sexual syndromes may yield greater understanding of 
tardive syndromes in general.

INTRODUCTION: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a widely used 
class of drug. Post-SSRI sexual dysfunction (PSSD) is a condition in which 
patients continue to have sexual side effects after discontinuation of SSRI use. 
The prevalence of persistent sexual side effects after discontinuing SSRIs is 
unknown. The recognition and study of PSSD will increase our knowledge base of 
this underreported and distressing condition.
AIM: To provide coverage of the current literature on PSSD, update information 
on the pathophysiology of PSSD, and discuss potential management options.
METHODS: Comprehensive review of literature pertaining to PSSD.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The symptoms, classification, pathophysiology, diagnostic 
considerations, and management of PSSD were reviewed.
RESULTS: Common PSSD symptoms include genital anesthesia, pleasure-less or weak 
orgasm, decreased sex drive, erectile dysfunction, and premature ejaculation. 
Different theories have been proposed to explain the pathophysiology of PSSD: 
epigenetic gene expression theory, cytochrome actions, dopamine-serotonin 
interactions, proopiomelanocortin and melanocortin effects, serotonin 
neurotoxicity, downregulation of 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1A, and hormonal 
changes in the central and peripheral nervous systems. The diagnosis of PSSD is 
achieved by excluding all other etiologies of sexual dysfunction. Treating PSSD 
is challenging, and many strategies have been suggested and tried, including 
serotonergic antagonists and dopaminergic agonists. There is still no definitive 
treatment for PSSD. Low-power laser irradiation and phototherapy have shown some 
promising results.
CONCLUSION: PSSD is a debilitating condition that adversely affects quality of 
life. Further studies are warranted to investigate the prevalence, 
pathophysiology, and treatment of PSSD. Bala A, Nguyen HMT, Hellstrom WJG.

INTRODUCTION: Sexual dysfunctions are well-known side effects of selective 
serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) use. Altered libido, erectile dysfunction, 
vaginal dryness, ejaculatory disorders, and orgasmic problems are frequently 
reported by patients treated with SSRIs. Moreover, these antidepressant-emergent 
sexual dysfunctions do not always resolve after discontinuation of the 
medication and can persist indefinitely. These complaints are termed post-SSRI 
sexual dysfunctions (PSSD).
AIM: To examine the existence of this clinical entity, possible theoretical 
mechanisms, possible risk factors, and possible treatment modalities.
METHODS: Through literature research and clinical experience, the available 
information about PSSD is reviewed.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Summary of the current literature with insights into 
possible causes and management options.
RESULTS: There are some indications that antidepressant-emergent sexual 
dysfunctions do not always resolve after discontinuation of the medication and 
can persist indefinitely in some individuals. Although some or all sexual side 
effects that start with the use of SSRIs might continue after stopping the 
medication, other sexual complaints can develop. Decreased capacity to 
experience sexual pleasure is the most frequent characteristic of this syndrome.
CONCLUSION: The research and understanding of PSSD remain limited and not well 
understood; however, the data support the existence of PSSD, which can have a 
substantial effect on the quality of life of these patients. More research is 
warranted to show the cause and possible mechanisms of PSSD that could lead to 
the correct diagnosis and treatment. Reisman Y. Sexual Consequences of Post-SSRI

Persistent sexual dysfunction after early exposure to SSRIs: Systematic review 
of animal studies.

Simonsen AL, Danborg PB, Gøtzsche PC.

BACKGROUND: Sexual dysfunction is a common adverse effect of selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and there is a concern that the sexual harms might 
persist after discontinuation of therapy.
OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the use of SSRIs in animals can lead to persistent 
sexual dysfunction.
METHODS: Systematic review of animal studies measuring sexual behaviour after 
end of treatment with SSRIs or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors.
DATA SOURCES: We searched PubMed and EMBASE.
RESULTS: We included 14 studies. The general quality of the studies was poor. 
Only four studies reported use of randomisation and none mentioned allocation 
concealment. All studies used placebo and were therefore blinded. For rats 
exposed to SSRIs compared with those exposed to placebo, we found a higher risk 
of no mounting behaviour (RR = 0.73; 95% CI = 0.62-0.86), no intromission 
behaviour (RR = 0.74; 95% CI = 0.60-0.92) and no ejaculation behaviour 
(RR = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.24-1.00).
CONCLUSION: Our results showed substantial and lasting effects on sexual 
behaviour in rats after exposure to an SSRI early in life on important sexual 
outcomes.

Emerging evidence suggests that sexual dysfunction emerging during treatment 
with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and/or 
serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) persists in some patients 
beyond drug discontinuation (post-SSRI sexual dysfunction [PSSD]). We sought to 
identify and characterize a series of such cases and explore possible 
explanatory factors and exposure-response relationship. Subjects who responded 
to an invitation in a forum dedicated to PSSD filled out a survey via online 
software. Case probability was defined according to the following 3 categories 
of increasing presumed likelihood of PSSD. Noncases did not meet the criteria 
for possible cases. Possible cases were subjects with normal pretreatment sexual 
function who first experienced sexual disturbances while using a single 
SSRI/SNRI, which did not resolve upon drug discontinuation for 1 month or longer 
as indicated by Arizona Sexual Experience Scale scores. High-probability cases 
were also younger than 50-year-olds; did not have confounding medical 
conditions, medications, or drug use; and had normal scores on the Hospital 
Anxiety and Depression Scale. Five hundred thirty-two (532) subjects completed 
the survey, among which 183 possible cases were identified, including 23 
high-probability cases. Female sex, genital anesthesia, and depression predicted 
current sexual dysfunction severity, but dose/defined daily dose ratio and 
anxiety did not. Genital anesthesia did not correlate with depression or 
anxiety, but pleasureless orgasm was an independent predictor of both depression 
and case probability. Limitations of the study include retrospective design and 
selection and report biases that do not allow generalization or estimation of 
incidence. However, our findings add to previous reports and support the 
existence of PSSD, which may not be fully explained by alternative 
nonpharmacological factors related to sexual dysfunction, including depression 
and anxiety.

Treatment of paroxetine-induced penile anesthesia in Post SSRI Sexual 
Dysfunction (PSSD) by Low-power Laser Irradiation (LPLI) is unknown in medical 
literature. The aim of the current article is to report partial efficacy of LPLI 
for paroxetine-induced persistent penile anesthesia. We report on a male patient 
who presented with a history of reversible loss of smell, taste and skin 
sensitivity occurring within a week after start of 20mg/day 
paroxetine-hemihydrate for a depressive period. Concurrently, patient suffered 
from penile anesthesia, scrotum hypesthesia, anejaculation and erectile 
difficulties with normal sexual desire. During 2.5 years of paroxetine treatment 
and throughout 2 years after paroxetine discontinuation, genital and sexual 
complaints persisted. Penile anesthesia was treated by LPLI with single and 
multi diode pulsed laser probes. After 20 LPLI-treatment sessions of 15min each, 
patient reported partial return of penile touch and temperature sensation. 
Clinical improvement of glans penis sensitivity was reported to 20% and 40%, 
compared to pre-paroxetine treatment penile sensitivity during erect and flaccid 
states, respectively. However, anejaculation and erectile difficulties remained 
unchanged. Briefly, in the current patient with early onset of PSSD, LPLI 
treatment reduced paroxetine-induced penile anesthesia. It is hypothesized that 
SSRI treatment induces disturbances of transient receptor potential (TRP) ion 
channels of mechano-, thermo- and chemosensitive nerve endings and receptors 
resulting in the penile anesthesia in PSSD. It is further hypothesized that 
there are two types of PSSD, one of which occurs soon after the start of SSRI 
treatment.

Psychiatric disorders and sexual dysfunction.

Sexual problems are highly prevalent among patients with psychiatric disorders. 
They may be caused by the psychopathology of the psychiatric disorder but also 
by its pharmacotherapy. Both positive symptoms (e.g., psychosis, hallucinations) 
as well as negative symptoms (e.g., anhedonia) of schizophrenia may negatively 
interfere with interpersonal and sexual relationships. Atypical antipsychotics 
have fewer sexual side-effects than the classic antipsychotics. Mood disorders 
may affect libido, sexual arousal, orgasm, and erectile function. With the 
exception of bupropion, agomelatine, mirtazapine, vortioxetine, amineptine, and 
moclobemide, all antidepressants cause sexual side-effects. Selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may particularly delay ejaculation and female 
orgasm, but also can cause decreased libido and erectile difficulties. 
SSRI-induced sexual side-effects are dose-dependent and reversible. Very rarely, 
their sexual side-effects persist after SSRI discontinuation. This is often 
preceded by genital anesthesia. Some personality characteristics are a risk 
factor for sexual dysfunction. Also patients with eating disorders may suffer 
from sexual difficulties. So far, research into psychotropic-induced sexual 
side-effects suffers from substantial methodologic limitations. Patients tend 
not to talk with their clinician about their sexual life. Psychiatrists and 
other doctors need to take the initiative to talk about the patient's sexual 
life in order to become informed about potential medication-induced sexual 
difficulties.

BACKGROUND: There have been reports for over a decade linking serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors, finasteride and isotretinoin with enduring sexual dysfunction after 
treatment stops.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical pictures linked to all 3 drugs.
METHODS: We have selected 120 reports to RxISK.org reporting the problem and 
mined these for data on age, gender, drug of use, and impact of the problem.
RESULTS: The data make it clear that the three drugs show extensive overlap in 
symptom profile, regardless of sex or country of origin.
CONCLUSIONS: The availability of 120 reports from over 20 countries add to the 
case for the validity of the syndrome. This is severe and enduring condition can 
result in death. An understanding of its physiology and an approach to treatment 
are needed.

[Does sexual dysfunction persist upon discontinuation of selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors?].

[Article in Dutch]

Ekhart GC, van Puijenbroek EP.

BACKGROUND: Cases reported in the literature suggest that in some individuals 
sexual dysfunction associated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
(SSRIS) may persist following the discontinuation of ssris.
AIM: To find out how many reports of persistent sexual dysfunction associated 
with the use of ssris were received by the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre, 
Lareb.
METHOD: The database of the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb was 
searched for reports of sexual dysfunction in patients who had been using SSRIS 
and whose sexual functioning had not returned to normal at the time of 
notification.
RESULTS: The database of the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb 
contained 19 reports of persistent sexual dysfunction in patients who had 
stopped using ssris for two months up to three years and who had not regained 
normal sexual functioning. The sexual disorders that were reported most 
frequently were reduced libido, erectile dysfunction and delayed orgasm. It 
seems likely that these disorders were caused not only by pharmacological 
effects of ssris but also by psychological factors.
CONCLUSION: Although it has previously been assumed that patients always regain 
normal sexual functioning shortly after discontinuation of ssris, emerging 
evidence suggests that this may not be the case.

Little is known with certitude about the triggers of persistent genital arousal 
disorder (PGAD) in women, although there appears to be certain common features 
of the disorder. Women complain of unbidden feelings of genital arousal that are 
qualitatively different from sexual arousal that is preceded by sexual 
desire/and or subjective arousal. The majority of women find PGAD distressing 
and report only brief relief with orgasm. In this article, we describe five 
women who believe they developed PGAD either after withdrawing from selective 
serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) anti-depressants or while using them. We 
discuss these sexual symptoms in relation to what is already known about 
prolonged SSRI withdrawal syndromes and the possible etiologies of these 
conditions. While not a common cause of PGAD, it is possible that use of, and 
withdrawal from, pharmacological agents contributes to the development of PGAD.

INTRODUCTION: Sexual dysfunctions such as low libido, anorgasmia, genital 
anesthesia, and erectile dysfunction are very common in patients taking 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). It has been assumed that these 
side effects always resolve after discontinuing treatment, but recently, four 
cases were presented in which sexual function did not return to baseline. Here, 
we describe three more cases. Case #1: A 29-year-old with apparently permanent 
erectile dysfunction after taking fluoxetine 20 mg once daily for a 4-month 
period in 1996. Case #2: A 44-year-old male with persistent loss of libido, 
genital anesthesia, ejaculatory anhedonia, and erectile dysfunction after taking 
20-mg once daily citalopram for 18 months. Case #3: A 28-year-old male with 
persistent loss of libido, genital anesthesia, and ejaculatory anhedonia since 
taking several different SSRIs over a 2-year period from 2003-2005.
RESULTS: No psychological issues related to sexuality were found in any of the 
three cases, and all common causes of sexual dysfunction such as decreased 
testosterone, increased prolactin or diabetes were ruled out. Erectile capacity 
is temporarily restored for Case #1 with injectable alprostadil, and for Case #2 
with oral sildenafil, but their other symptoms remain. Case #3 has had some 
reversal of symptoms with extended-release methylphenidate, although it is not 
yet known if these prosexual effects will persist when the drug is discontinued.
CONCLUSION: SSRIs can cause long-term effects on all aspects of the sexual 
response cycle that may persist after they are discontinued. Mechanistic 
hypotheses including persistent endocrine and epigenetic gene expression 
alterations were briefly discussed.

Sexual side-effects, in general, are common with selective serotonin-reuptake 
inhibitors (SSRIs). Genital anaesthesia is a rare side-effect previously 
described with sertraline and fluoxetine use. With SSRI discontinuation, the 
sexual side-effects are expected to resolve. We report a case of a 26-year-old 
male who experienced genital anaesthesia during sertraline treatment and 
continued to be symptomatic despite medication discontinuation 6 years 
previously. To date, there have been no published reports of SSRI-induced sexual 
side-effects persisting beyond SSRI discontinuation. This case highlights the 
complex interplay of psychopharmacologic and psychodynamic factors that can 
occur in patients with sexual dysfunction.
