TI  - Cutting the First Turf to Heal Post-SSRI Sexual Dysfunction: A Male Retrospective 
      Cohort Study.
LID - 10.3390/medicines9090045 [doi]
LID - 45
AB  - Post-SSRI sexual dysfunction (PSSD) is a set of heterogeneous sexual problems, 
      which may arise during the administration of selective serotonin reuptake 
      inhibitors (SSRIs) and persist after their discontinuation. PSSD is a rare 
      clinical entity, and it is commonly associated with non-sexual concerns, 
      including emotional and cognitive problems and poor quality of life. To date, 
      however, no effective treatment is available. The aim of this study was to 
      retrospectively evaluate the potential efficacy of the different treatments used 
      in clinical practice in improving male PSSD. Of the 30 patients referred to our 
      neurobehavioral outpatient clinic from January 2020 to December 2021, 13 
      Caucasian male patients (mean age 29.53 ± 4.57 years), previously treated with 
      SSRIs, were included in the study. Patients with major depressive disorder and/or 
      psychotic symptoms were excluded a priori to avoid overlapping symptomatology, 
      and potentially reduce the misdiagnosis rate. To treat PSSD, we decided to use 
      drugs positively affecting the brain dopamine/serotonin ratio, such as bupropion 
      and vortioxetine, as well as other compounds. This latter drug is known not to 
      cause or reverse iatrogenic SD. Most patients, after treatment with vortioxetine 
      and/or nutraceuticals, reported a significant improvement in all International 
      Index of Erectile Function-(IIEF-5) domains (p &lt; 0.05) from baseline (T0) to 
      12-month follow-up (T1). Moreover, the only patient treated with pelvic muscle 
      vibration reached very positive results. Although our data come from a 
      retrospective open-label study with a small sample size, drugs positively 
      modulating the central nervous system serotonin/dopamine ratio, such as 
      vortioxetine, could be used to potentially improve PSSD. Large-sample prospective 
      cohort studies and randomized clinical trials are needed to investigate the real 
      prevalence of this clinical entity and confirm such a promising approach to a 
      potentially debilitating illness.

TI  - Persistent sexual dysfunction after SSRI withdrawal: a scoping review and 
      presentation of 86 cases from the Netherlands.
PG  - 553-561
LID - 10.1080/14740338.2022.2007883 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sexual dysfunction is highly prevalent worldwide. A specific form is 
      persistent sexual dysfunction after SSRI withdrawal. We conducted a systematic 
      literature review in order to characterize factors related to post SSRI sexual 
      dysfunction (PSSD) and analyzed spontaneous reports of persistent sexual 
      dysfunction reported to the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Center Lareb. RESEARCH 
      DESIGN AND METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted following the 
      PRISMA-ScR guidelines. In addition, reports of PSSD submitted to the Netherlands 
      Pharmacovigilance Center Lareb between 1992 and 2021 were analyzed. RESULTS: A 
      total of 237 articles were retrieved through the search and 33 articles were 
      selected for inclusion in this review, in accordance with the inclusion criteria. 
      Information regarding the characteristics of the condition, its clinical 
      management, patient characteristics, and impact of PSSD is presented. A total of 
      86 reports of persistent sexual dysfunction were analyzed. The longest case being 
      a patient with PSSD for 23 years. The main symptoms were: loss or decreased 
      libido (n = 53), erectile dysfunction (n = 23) and anorgasmia (n = 5). 
      CONCLUSIONS: PSSD impact includes sexual, psychological, and social consequences. 
      Little is known about the mechanisms underlying PSSD and no effective treatment 
      exists. It is necessary to increase recognition of PSSD among prescribers and 
      improve its management at the clinical level.

TI  - Diagnostic criteria for enduring sexual dysfunction after treatment with 
      antidepressants, finasteride and isotretinoin.
PG  - 65-76
LID - 10.3233/JRS-210023 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A set of enduring conditions have been reported in the literature 
      involving persistent sexual dysfunction after discontinuation of serotonin 
      reuptake inhibiting antidepressants, 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors and 
      isotretinoin. OBJECTIVE: To develop diagnostic criteria for post-SSRI sexual 
      dysfunction (PSSD), persistent genital arousal disorder (PGAD) following 
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors, post-finasteride syndrome (PFS) and post-retinoid 
      sexual dysfunction (PRSD). METHODS: The original draft was designed using data 
      from two published case series (Hogan et al., 2014 and Healy et al., 2018), which 
      represent the largest public collections of data on these enduring conditions. It 
      was further developed with the involvement of a multidisciplinary panel of 
      experts. RESULTS: A set of criteria were agreed upon for each of the above 
      conditions. Features of PSSD, PFS and PRSD commonly include decreased genital and 
      orgasmic sensation, decreased sexual desire and erectile dysfunction. Ancillary 
      non-sexual symptoms vary depending on the specific condition but can include 
      emotional blunting and cognitive impairment. PGAD presents with an almost mirror 
      image of unwanted sensations of genital arousal or irritability in the absence of 
      sexual desire. A new term, post-SSRI asexuality, is introduced to describe a 
      dampening of sexual interest and pleasure resulting from a pre-natal or pre-teen 
      exposure to a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS: These criteria will help 
      in both clinical and research settings. As with all criteria, they will likely 
      need modification in the light of developments.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Post-SSRI sexual-dysfunction (PSSD) is an iatrogenic syndrome, the 
      underlying neurobiological mechanisms of which are unclear. Symptom onset follows 
      cessation of serotonergic antidepressants i.e. Selective Serotonin and 
      Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI's, SNRI's), and Tricyclic 
      antidepressants (TCA's). PSSD symptoms include genital anesthesia, erectile 
      dysfunction and orgasmic/ejaculatory anhedonia, and should be differentiated from 
      depression-related sexual-dysfunction. Recently, accumulated data of numerous 
      case-reports suggest additional non-sexual symptoms including, anhedonia, apathy, 
      and blunted affect. PSSD gained official recognition after the European medical 
      agency concluded that PSSD is a medical condition that persists after 
      discontinuation of SSRI's and SNRI's. OBJECTIVE: To review possible underlying 
      neurobiological mechanisms of this syndrome, update information on the 
      pathophysiology, present a list of potential risk-factors and discuss potential 
      management options for PSSD. METHODS: Extensive literature review on the main 
      symptom-patterns of this disorder was undertaken using PubMed. It includes 
      introductory explications of relevant neurobiology with the objective of 
      generating hypothesis. RESULTS: Precipitating factors for PSSD include previous 
      exposure to certain drugs, genetic predisposition, psychological stress or 
      chemical stressful reaction to antidepressants along pre-existing medical 
      conditions affecting neuroplasticity. Different theories have been proposed to 
      explain the pathophysiology of PSSD: epigenetic gene expression, 
      dopamine-serotonin interactions, serotonin neurotoxicity and hormonal changes. 
      The diagnosis of PSSD is achieved by excluding all other etiologies of 
      sexual-dysfunction. Treatment is challenging, and many strategies have been 
      suggested without definitive outcomes. We offer the contours of a future 
      neurobiological research agenda, and propose several underlying mechanisms for

AB  - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) show high efficacy in treating 
      depression, however during treatment side effects, like for instance sexual 
      dysfunction, may appear, decreasing compliance. In some cases, this condition 
      will last after drug discontinuation, leading to the so-called post-SSRI sexual 
      dysfunction (PSSD). The etiology of PSSD is still unknown, however a role for 
      neuroactive steroids may be hypothesized. Indeed, these molecules are key 
      physiological regulators of the nervous system, and their alteration has been 
      associated with several neuropathological conditions, including depression. 
      Additionally, neuroactive steroids are also involved in the control of sexual 
      function. Interestingly, sexual dysfunction induced by SSRI treatment has been 
      also observed in animal models. On this basis, we have here evaluated whether a 
      subchronic treatment with paroxetine for two weeks and/or its withdrawal (i.e., a 
      month) may affect the levels of neuroactive steroids in brain areas (i.e., 
      hippocampus, hypothalamus, and cerebral cortex) and/or in plasma and 
      cerebrospinal fluid of male rats. Data obtained indicate that the SSRI treatment 
      alters neuroactive steroid levels and the expression of key enzymes of the 
      steroidogenesis in a brain tissue- and time-dependent manner. Indeed, these 
      observations with the finding that plasma levels of neuroactive steroids are not 
      affected suggest that the effect of paroxetine treatment is directly on 
      neurosteroidogenesis. In particular, a negative impact on the expression of 
      steroidogenic enzymes was observed at the withdrawal. Therefore, it is possible 
      to hypothesize that altered neurosteroidogenesis may also occur in PSSD and 
      consequently it may represent a possible pharmacological target for this 
      disorder.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Post-SSRI sexual dysfunction (PSSD) is an underrecognized and poorly 
      understood medical condition characterized by sexual dysfunction that persists 
      despite SSRI discontinuation. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a survey of individuals 
      with PSSD to better characterize this condition and its impact on various quality 
      of life concerns. METHODS: Surveys were distributed to an online support group 
      for individuals with PSSD. Surveys assessed medications suspected of causing PSSD 
      and symptoms experienced during and after treatment. Respondents reported the 
      trajectory of their condition, the efficacy of different treatments, and the 
      impact of PSSD on their quality of life. RESULTS: 239 survey responses were 
      included in this study. A majority of respondents had a history of SSRI use (92%) 
      compared to only SNRI or atypical antidepressant use (8%). The overall severity 
      of symptoms improved for 45% and worsened or remained the same for 37% of 
      respondents after discontinuing treatment with serotonin reuptake inhibitors. 
      Only 12% of respondents reported being counseled regarding potential sexual 
      dysfunction while taking antidepressants. The majority rated the effect of PSSD 
      on their quality of life as extremely negative (59%) or very negative (23%). 
      CONCLUSION: PSSD can have an overwhelmingly negative impact on quality of life. 
      Currently, it is unclear why certain individuals develop PSSD and there are no 
      definitive treatments for this condition. Further research of PSSD and greater 
      awareness of this condition is needed among prescribers of serotonin reuptake 
      inhibitors to improve patient care.

PG  - 229-242
LID - 10.3233/JRS-200074 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Post-SSRI Sexual Dysfunction (PSSD) is characterized by sexual and 
      emotional symptoms associated to the exposure to Selective Serotonin Reuptake 
      Inhibitors (SSRI) or Serotonin Noradrenaline Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRI). 
      OBJECTIVE: The present study provides a comprehensive picture on demographic and 
      clinical characteristics associated to PSSD. METHODS: An online survey was run on 
      subjects self-declaring as affected by PSSD. The survey collected 
      socio-demographic and clinical data via questions created ad hoc and three 
      standardized scales (Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale, Hospital Anxiety and 
      Depression Scale, World Health Organization Wellbeing Index). RESULTS: A total of 
      135 subjects (115 males; mean age 31.9 ± 8.9 years) was analysed. The syndrome 
      was more represented among young, heterosexual males after the exposure to 
      SSRI/SNRI at relatively high doses. The major findings involved the temporal 
      sequence of symptoms: 118 subjects had symptoms both during and after SSRI/SNRI 
      administration, and 17 only after, thus deposing for a iatrogenic action of 
      SSRI/SNRI. Different variables, represented by both emotional and sexual 
      symptoms, accounted for the variability of the severity of the sexual dysfunction 
      as well as of wellbeing. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the present results, PSSD is a 
      complex iatrogenic syndrome in need of being further studied and understood.

TI  - Antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction.
PG  - 329-334
LID - 10.5694/mja2.50522 [doi]
AB  - Sexual dysfunction is a frequent, potentially distressing, adverse effect of 
      antidepressants and a leading cause of medication non-adherence. Sexual function 
      should be actively assessed at baseline, at regular intervals during treatment, 
      and after treatment cessation. Trials comparing the risk of sexual dysfunction 
      with individual antidepressants are inadequate, but it is reasonable to conclude 
      that the risk is greatest with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) 
      and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), less with tricyclic 
      antidepressants (except clomipramine) and mirtazapine, and least with 
      moclobemide, agomelatine, reboxetine and bupropion. Management of 
      antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction requires an individualised approach 
      (eg, considering other causes, dose reduction, addition of medication to treat 
      the adverse effect, switching to a different antidepressant). Post-SSRI sexual 
      dysfunction has been recently identified as a potential, although rare, adverse 
      effect of SSRIs and SNRIs. Consider the possibility of post-SSRI sexual 
      dysfunction in patients in whom sexual dysfunction was absent before starting 
      antidepressants but develops during or soon after antidepressant treatment and 
      still persists after remission from depression and discontinuation of the drug.

TI  - Post-SSRI Sexual Dysfunction: A Bioelectric Mechanism?
PG  - 7-13
LID - 10.1089/bioe.2019.0010 [doi]
AB  - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) drugs, targeting serotonin 
      transport, are widely used. A puzzling and biomedically important phenomenon 
      concerns the persistent sexual dysfunction following SSRI use seen in some 
      patients. What could be the mechanism of a persistent physiological state brought 
      on by a transient exposure to serotonin transport blockers? In this study, we 
      briefly review the clinical facts concerning this side effect of serotonin 
      reuptake inhibitors and suggest a possible mechanism. Bioelectric circuits (among 
      neural or non-neural cells) could persistently maintain alterations of 
      bioelectric cell properties (resting potential), resulting in long-term changes 
      in electrophysiology and signaling. We present new data revealing this phenomenon 
      in planarian flatworms, in which brief SSRI exposures induce long-lasting changes 
      in resting potential profile. We also briefly review recent data linking 
      neurotransmitter signaling to developmental bioelectrics. Further study of tissue 
      bioelectric memory could enable the design of ionoceutical interventions to 
      counteract side effects of SSRIs and similar drugs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: A petition to the European Medicines Agency provided an opportunity to 
      collect reports of a specific adverse event from patients and healthcare 
      professionals, along with details of clinicians' attitudes when asked to endorse 
      patient reports. METHODS: We approached a cohort of patients reporting post-SSRI 
      sexual dysfunction (PSSD) to an adverse event reporting website, RxISK.org. The 
      responses of patients on their interactions with healthcare professionals were 
      subject to a qualitative analysis. RESULTS: A total of 62 participants from 23 
      countries provided details of their experiences. While some had received support 
      and validation of their condition, many described a number of difficulties 
      including a lack of awareness or knowledge about PSSD, not being listened to, 
      receiving unsympathetic or inappropriate responses, and a refusal to engage with 
      the published medical literature. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare professionals are 
      nervous about or reluctant to engage with novel problems on a treatment. This is 
      not widely appreciated and the reasons for this concern are not understood.

AB  - Post-selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) sexual dysfunction (PSSD) is 
      a new clinical entity occurring after the antidepressant intake, and it is 
      characterized by the fact that patients continue to present sexual side effects 
      after the discontinuation of the drugs. PSSD mainly consists of hypo-anesthesia 
      of the genital area, loss of libido, and erectile dysfunction. Although different 
      management options have been proposed, there is no consensus on the treatment for 
      this syndrome. Herein we report on a young man affected by PSSD who regained 
      sexual functioning after 3-month treatment with EDOVIS, a dietary supplement 
      containing L-citrulline and other commonly used aphrodisiacs. Clinicians should 
      be aware about the possibility of persistent sexual side effects induced by 
      serotoninergic antidepressants and take into considerations the use of 
      nutraceuticals to overcome PSSD.

TI  - Post-finasteride syndrome and post-SSRI sexual dysfunction: two sides of the same 
      coin?
PG  - 180-193
LID - 10.1007/s12020-018-1593-5 [doi]
AB  - Sexual dysfunction is a clinical condition due to different causes including the 
      iatrogenic origin. For instance, it is well known that sexual dysfunction may 
      occur in patients treated with antidepressants like selective serotonin reuptake 
      inhibitors (SSRI). A similar side effect has been also reported during treatment 
      with finasteride, an inhibitor of the enzyme 5alpha-reductase, for androgenetic 
      alopecia. Interestingly, sexual dysfunction persists in both cases after drug 
      discontinuation. These conditions have been named post-SSRI sexual dysfunction 
      (PSSD) and post-finasteride syndrome (PFS). In particular, feeling of a lack of 
      connection between the brain and penis, loss of libido and sex drive, difficulty 
      in achieving an erection and genital paresthesia have been reported by patients 
      of both conditions. It is interesting to note that the incidence of these 
      diseases is probably so far underestimated and their etiopathogenesis is not 
      sufficiently explored. To this aim, the present review will report the state of 
      art of these two different pathologies and discuss, on the basis of the role 
      exerted by three different neuromodulators such as dopamine, serotonin and 
      neuroactive steroids, whether the persistent sexual dysfunction observed could be 
      determined by common mechanisms.

AB  - Commonly used pharmaceutical drugs might alter the epigenetic state of cells, 
      leading to varying degrees of long-term repercussions to human health. To test 
      this hypothesis, we cultured HEK-293 cells in the presence of 50 μM citalopram, a 
      common antidepressant, for 30 days and performed whole-genome DNA methylation 
      analysis using the NimbleGen Human DNA Methylation 3x720K Promoter Plus CpG 
      Island Array. A total of 626 gene promoters, out of a total of 25,437 queried 
      genes on the array (2.46%), showed significant differential methylation (p < 
      0.01); among these, 272 were hypomethylated and 354 were hypermethylated in 
      treated versus control. Using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, we found that the chief 
      gene networks and signaling pathways that are differentially regulated include 
      those involved in nervous system development and function and cellular growth and 
      proliferation. Genes implicated in depression, as well as genetic networks 
      involving nucleic acid metabolism, small molecule biochemistry, and cell cycle 
      regulation were significantly modified. Involvement of upstream regulators such 
      as BDNF, FSH, and NFκB was predicted based on differential methylation of their 
      downstream targets. The study validates our hypothesis that pharmaceutical drugs 
      can have off-target epigenetic effects and reveals affected networks and 
      pathways. We view this study as a first step towards understanding the long-term 
      epigenetic consequences of prescription drugs on human health.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a widely used 
      class of drug for various psychiatric disorders during the lifespan, including 
      pregnancy, lactation, childhood, and adolescence. Deterioration in sexual 
      functioning is a major and serious adverse effect of SSRIs. There is emerging 
      evidence that SSRIs can have long-lasting effects on sexuality. AIM: To summarize 
      the long-lasting effects of SSRIs on sexuality, starting with animal models and 
      continuing with the clinical experience of different investigators. METHOD: A 
      literature review of relevant publications in PubMed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: To 
      assess the long-lasting effects of SSRIs on sexuality. RESULTS: Although the 
      persistent effects of SSRIs on sexuality have been little studied in humans, 
      animal studies suggest that SSRIs might cause permanent sexual dysfunction after 
      ending SSRI exposure at a young age but not in adulthood in rats. There are no 
      prospective randomized controlled trials in humans and the present evidence is 
      derived from case reports, incidental research findings, and experiences of some 
      internet communities. CONCLUSION: There is some preclinical evidence from animal 
      studies for enduring SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction, but the available clinical 
      information could prevent a clear decision about the existence of post-SSRI 
      sexual dysfunction, its pathophysiology, and its management. We need more 
      research to fill in the gaps in our knowledge. Coskuner ER, Culha MG, Ozkan B,

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate clinical reports of post-SSRI sexual dysfunction 
      (PSSD), post-finasteride syndrome (PFS) and enduring sexual dysfunction following 
      isotretinoin. METHODS: Data from RxISK.org, a global adverse event reporting 
      website, have been used to establish the clinical features, demographic details 
      and clinical trajectories of syndromes of persistent sexual difficulties 
      following three superficially different treatment modalities.RESULTSWe report on 
      300 cases of enduring sexual dysfunction from 37 countries following 14 different 
      drugs comprised of serotonin reuptake inhibiting antidepressants, 5α-reductase 
      inhibitors and isotretinoin. While reports of certain issues were unique to the 
      antidepressants, such as the onset of premature ejaculation and persistent 
      genital arousal disorder (PGAD), there was also a significant overlap in symptom 
      profile between the drug groups, with common features including genital 
      anaesthesia, pleasureless or weak orgasm, loss of libido and impotence. Secondary 
      consequences included relationship breakdown and impaired quality of 
      life.CONCLUSIONSThese data point to a legacy syndrome or syndromes comprising a 
      range of disturbances to sexual function. More detailed studies will require 
      developments in coding systems that recognise the condition(s). Further 
      exploration of these tardive sexual syndromes may yield greater understanding of 
      tardive syndromes in general.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a widely used 
      class of drug. Post-SSRI sexual dysfunction (PSSD) is a condition in which 
      patients continue to have sexual side effects after discontinuation of SSRI use. 
      The prevalence of persistent sexual side effects after discontinuing SSRIs is 
      unknown. The recognition and study of PSSD will increase our knowledge base of 
      this underreported and distressing condition. AIM: To provide coverage of the 
      current literature on PSSD, update information on the pathophysiology of PSSD, 
      and discuss potential management options. METHODS: Comprehensive review of 
      literature pertaining to PSSD. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The symptoms, 
      classification, pathophysiology, diagnostic considerations, and management of 
      PSSD were reviewed. RESULTS: Common PSSD symptoms include genital anesthesia, 
      pleasure-less or weak orgasm, decreased sex drive, erectile dysfunction, and 
      premature ejaculation. Different theories have been proposed to explain the 
      pathophysiology of PSSD: epigenetic gene expression theory, cytochrome actions, 
      dopamine-serotonin interactions, proopiomelanocortin and melanocortin effects, 
      serotonin neurotoxicity, downregulation of 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1A, and 
      hormonal changes in the central and peripheral nervous systems. The diagnosis of 
      PSSD is achieved by excluding all other etiologies of sexual dysfunction. 
      Treating PSSD is challenging, and many strategies have been suggested and tried, 
      including serotonergic antagonists and dopaminergic agonists. There is still no 
      definitive treatment for PSSD. Low-power laser irradiation and phototherapy have 
      shown some promising results. CONCLUSION: PSSD is a debilitating condition that 
      adversely affects quality of life. Further studies are warranted to investigate 
      the prevalence, pathophysiology, and treatment of PSSD. Bala A, Nguyen HMT,

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sexual dysfunctions are well-known side effects of selective 
      serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) use. Altered libido, erectile dysfunction, 
      vaginal dryness, ejaculatory disorders, and orgasmic problems are frequently 
      reported by patients treated with SSRIs. Moreover, these antidepressant-emergent 
      sexual dysfunctions do not always resolve after discontinuation of the medication 
      and can persist indefinitely. These complaints are termed post-SSRI sexual 
      dysfunctions (PSSD). AIM: To examine the existence of this clinical entity, 
      possible theoretical mechanisms, possible risk factors, and possible treatment 
      modalities. METHODS: Through literature research and clinical experience, the 
      available information about PSSD is reviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Summary of 
      the current literature with insights into possible causes and management options. 
      RESULTS: There are some indications that antidepressant-emergent sexual 
      dysfunctions do not always resolve after discontinuation of the medication and 
      can persist indefinitely in some individuals. Although some or all sexual side 
      effects that start with the use of SSRIs might continue after stopping the 
      medication, other sexual complaints can develop. Decreased capacity to experience 
      sexual pleasure is the most frequent characteristic of this syndrome. CONCLUSION: 
      The research and understanding of PSSD remain limited and not well understood; 
      however, the data support the existence of PSSD, which can have a substantial 
      effect on the quality of life of these patients. More research is warranted to 
      show the cause and possible mechanisms of PSSD that could lead to the correct 
      diagnosis and treatment. Reisman Y. Sexual Consequences of Post-SSRI Syndrome.

TI  - Persistent sexual dysfunction after early exposure to SSRIs: Systematic review of 
      animal studies.
PG  - 1-12
LID - 10.3233/JRS-160668 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sexual dysfunction is a common adverse effect of selective serotonin 
      reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and there is a concern that the sexual harms might 
      persist after discontinuation of therapy. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the use of 
      SSRIs in animals can lead to persistent sexual dysfunction. METHODS: Systematic 
      review of animal studies measuring sexual behaviour after end of treatment with 
      SSRIs or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. DATA SOURCES: We searched 
      PubMed and EMBASE. RESULTS: We included 14 studies. The general quality of the 
      studies was poor. Only four studies reported use of randomisation and none 
      mentioned allocation concealment. All studies used placebo and were therefore 
      blinded. For rats exposed to SSRIs compared with those exposed to placebo, we 
      found a higher risk of no mounting behaviour (RR = 0.73; 95% CI = 0.62-0.86), no 
      intromission behaviour (RR = 0.74; 95% CI = 0.60-0.92) and no ejaculation 
      behaviour (RR = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.24-1.00). CONCLUSION: Our results showed 
      substantial and lasting effects on sexual behaviour in rats after exposure to an 
      SSRI early in life on important sexual outcomes.

TI  - Post-SSRI Sexual Dysfunction: Clinical Characterization and Preliminary 
      Assessment of Contributory Factors and Dose-Response Relationship.
PG  - 273-8
LID - 10.1097/JCP.0000000000000300 [doi]
AB  - Emerging evidence suggests that sexual dysfunction emerging during treatment with 
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and/or serotonin-norepinephrine 
      reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) persists in some patients beyond drug discontinuation 
      (post-SSRI sexual dysfunction [PSSD]). We sought to identify and characterize a 
      series of such cases and explore possible explanatory factors and 
      exposure-response relationship. Subjects who responded to an invitation in a 
      forum dedicated to PSSD filled out a survey via online software. Case probability 
      was defined according to the following 3 categories of increasing presumed 
      likelihood of PSSD. Noncases did not meet the criteria for possible cases. 
      Possible cases were subjects with normal pretreatment sexual function who first 
      experienced sexual disturbances while using a single SSRI/SNRI, which did not 
      resolve upon drug discontinuation for 1 month or longer as indicated by Arizona 
      Sexual Experience Scale scores. High-probability cases were also younger than 
      50-year-olds; did not have confounding medical conditions, medications, or drug 
      use; and had normal scores on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Five 
      hundred thirty-two (532) subjects completed the survey, among which 183 possible 
      cases were identified, including 23 high-probability cases. Female sex, genital 
      anesthesia, and depression predicted current sexual dysfunction severity, but 
      dose/defined daily dose ratio and anxiety did not. Genital anesthesia did not 
      correlate with depression or anxiety, but pleasureless orgasm was an independent 
      predictor of both depression and case probability. Limitations of the study 
      include retrospective design and selection and report biases that do not allow 
      generalization or estimation of incidence. However, our findings add to previous 
      reports and support the existence of PSSD, which may not be fully explained by 
      alternative nonpharmacological factors related to sexual dysfunction, including 
      depression and anxiety.

TI  - Penile anesthesia in Post SSRI Sexual Dysfunction (PSSD) responds to low-power

AB  - Treatment of paroxetine-induced penile anesthesia in Post SSRI Sexual Dysfunction 
      (PSSD) by Low-power Laser Irradiation (LPLI) is unknown in medical literature. 
      The aim of the current article is to report partial efficacy of LPLI for 
      paroxetine-induced persistent penile anesthesia. We report on a male patient who 
      presented with a history of reversible loss of smell, taste and skin sensitivity 
      occurring within a week after start of 20mg/day paroxetine-hemihydrate for a 
      depressive period. Concurrently, patient suffered from penile anesthesia, scrotum 
      hypesthesia, anejaculation and erectile difficulties with normal sexual desire. 
      During 2.5 years of paroxetine treatment and throughout 2 years after paroxetine 
      discontinuation, genital and sexual complaints persisted. Penile anesthesia was 
      treated by LPLI with single and multi diode pulsed laser probes. After 20 
      LPLI-treatment sessions of 15min each, patient reported partial return of penile 
      touch and temperature sensation. Clinical improvement of glans penis sensitivity 
      was reported to 20% and 40%, compared to pre-paroxetine treatment penile 
      sensitivity during erect and flaccid states, respectively. However, anejaculation 
      and erectile difficulties remained unchanged. Briefly, in the current patient 
      with early onset of PSSD, LPLI treatment reduced paroxetine-induced penile 
      anesthesia. It is hypothesized that SSRI treatment induces disturbances of 
      transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels of mechano-, thermo- and 
      chemosensitive nerve endings and receptors resulting in the penile anesthesia in 
      PSSD. It is further hypothesized that there are two types of PSSD, one of which 
      occurs soon after the start of SSRI treatment.

AB  - Sexual problems are highly prevalent among patients with psychiatric disorders. 
      They may be caused by the psychopathology of the psychiatric disorder but also by 
      its pharmacotherapy. Both positive symptoms (e.g., psychosis, hallucinations) as 
      well as negative symptoms (e.g., anhedonia) of schizophrenia may negatively 
      interfere with interpersonal and sexual relationships. Atypical antipsychotics 
      have fewer sexual side-effects than the classic antipsychotics. Mood disorders 
      may affect libido, sexual arousal, orgasm, and erectile function. With the 
      exception of bupropion, agomelatine, mirtazapine, vortioxetine, amineptine, and 
      moclobemide, all antidepressants cause sexual side-effects. Selective serotonin 
      reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may particularly delay ejaculation and female orgasm, 
      but also can cause decreased libido and erectile difficulties. SSRI-induced 
      sexual side-effects are dose-dependent and reversible. Very rarely, their sexual 
      side-effects persist after SSRI discontinuation. This is often preceded by 
      genital anesthesia. Some personality characteristics are a risk factor for sexual 
      dysfunction. Also patients with eating disorders may suffer from sexual 
      difficulties. So far, research into psychotropic-induced sexual side-effects 
      suffers from substantial methodologic limitations. Patients tend not to talk with 
      their clinician about their sexual life. Psychiatrists and other doctors need to 
      take the initiative to talk about the patient's sexual life in order to become 
      informed about potential medication-induced sexual difficulties.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There have been reports for over a decade linking serotonin reuptake 
      inhibitors, finasteride and isotretinoin with enduring sexual dysfunction after 
      treatment stops. OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical pictures linked to all 3 
      drugs. METHODS: We have selected 120 reports to RxISK.org reporting the problem 
      and mined these for data on age, gender, drug of use, and impact of the problem. 
      RESULTS: The data make it clear that the three drugs show extensive overlap in 
      symptom profile, regardless of sex or country of origin. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      availability of 120 reports from over 20 countries add to the case for the 
      validity of the syndrome. This is severe and enduring condition can result in 
      death. An understanding of its physiology and an approach to treatment are 
      needed.

      reuptake inhibitors?].
PG  - 336-40
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cases reported in the literature suggest that in some individuals 
      sexual dysfunction associated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
      (SSRIS) may persist following the discontinuation of ssris. AIM: To find out how 
      many reports of persistent sexual dysfunction associated with the use of ssris 
      were received by the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre, Lareb. METHOD: The 
      database of the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb was searched for 
      reports of sexual dysfunction in patients who had been using SSRIS and whose 
      sexual functioning had not returned to normal at the time of notification. 
      RESULTS: The database of the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb contained 
      19 reports of persistent sexual dysfunction in patients who had stopped using 
      ssris for two months up to three years and who had not regained normal sexual 
      functioning. The sexual disorders that were reported most frequently were reduced 
      libido, erectile dysfunction and delayed orgasm. It seems likely that these 
      disorders were caused not only by pharmacological effects of ssris but also by 
      psychological factors. CONCLUSION: Although it has previously been assumed that 
      patients always regain normal sexual functioning shortly after discontinuation of 
      ssris, emerging evidence suggests that this may not be the case.

TI  - Persistent genital arousal disorder in women: case reports of association with 
      anti-depressant usage and withdrawal.

AB  - Little is known with certitude about the triggers of persistent genital arousal 
      disorder (PGAD) in women, although there appears to be certain common features of 
      the disorder. Women complain of unbidden feelings of genital arousal that are 
      qualitatively different from sexual arousal that is preceded by sexual desire/and 
      or subjective arousal. The majority of women find PGAD distressing and report 
      only brief relief with orgasm. In this article, we describe five women who 
      believe they developed PGAD either after withdrawing from selective serotonin 
      reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) anti-depressants or while using them. We discuss these 
      sexual symptoms in relation to what is already known about prolonged SSRI 
      withdrawal syndromes and the possible etiologies of these conditions. While not a 
      common cause of PGAD, it is possible that use of, and withdrawal from, 
      pharmacological agents contributes to the development of PGAD.

TI  - Persistent sexual dysfunction after discontinuation of selective serotonin 
      reuptake inhibitors.
PG  - 227-33

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sexual dysfunctions such as low libido, anorgasmia, genital 
      anesthesia, and erectile dysfunction are very common in patients taking selective 
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). It has been assumed that these side 
      effects always resolve after discontinuing treatment, but recently, four cases 
      were presented in which sexual function did not return to baseline. Here, we 
      describe three more cases. Case #1: A 29-year-old with apparently permanent 
      erectile dysfunction after taking fluoxetine 20 mg once daily for a 4-month 
      period in 1996. Case #2: A 44-year-old male with persistent loss of libido, 
      genital anesthesia, ejaculatory anhedonia, and erectile dysfunction after taking 
      20-mg once daily citalopram for 18 months. Case #3: A 28-year-old male with 
      persistent loss of libido, genital anesthesia, and ejaculatory anhedonia since 
      taking several different SSRIs over a 2-year period from 2003-2005. RESULTS: No 
      psychological issues related to sexuality were found in any of the three cases, 
      and all common causes of sexual dysfunction such as decreased testosterone, 
      increased prolactin or diabetes were ruled out. Erectile capacity is temporarily 
      restored for Case #1 with injectable alprostadil, and for Case #2 with oral 
      sildenafil, but their other symptoms remain. Case #3 has had some reversal of 
      symptoms with extended-release methylphenidate, although it is not yet known if 
      these prosexual effects will persist when the drug is discontinued. CONCLUSION: 
      SSRIs can cause long-term effects on all aspects of the sexual response cycle 
      that may persist after they are discontinued. Mechanistic hypotheses including 
      persistent endocrine and epigenetic gene expression alterations were briefly 
      discussed.

TI  - Genital anaesthesia persisting six years after sertraline discontinuation.
PG  - 327-30
AB  - Sexual side-effects, in general, are common with selective serotonin-reuptake 
      inhibitors (SSRIs). Genital anaesthesia is a rare side-effect previously 
      described with sertraline and fluoxetine use. With SSRI discontinuation, the 
      sexual side-effects are expected to resolve. We report a case of a 26-year-old 
      male who experienced genital anaesthesia during sertraline treatment and 
      continued to be symptomatic despite medication discontinuation 6 years 
      previously. To date, there have been no published reports of SSRI-induced sexual 
      side-effects persisting beyond SSRI discontinuation. This case highlights the 
      complex interplay of psychopharmacologic and psychodynamic factors that can occur 
      in patients with sexual dysfunction.
